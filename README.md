# installation

OSX
Type `installer` on the command line.  This will copy `deploy` and `deploy.sh` to the `/usr/local/bin` folder which should already be part of your path variable.

To check your path type `echo $PATH`  If `/usr/local/bin` is not in your `$PATH` add it by updating your startup file.
